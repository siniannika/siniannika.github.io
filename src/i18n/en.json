            "EasyOpp": "Designing and developing ERP software in a product development team. Two of our main applications include mobile PWA which is used by employees of our customers to log, edit and view their work-hours and related information. And a Desktop web app which includes e.g. approving work-hours, transfering salaries to integration and other administrative features like configuration of work-hour and salary calculation.<br /><br />I was the main developer when we implemented the new mobile UI (ReactJS + TypeScript) from scratch. Creating a base to start building the application, implementing core features and generic components as well as reviewing other people's work. I also did the infrastructure setup for Azure deployment.<br /><br />I've also had the responsibility to be designing the renewal of our salary calculation process including the underlying data model improvements and how the process could be made easier for the user and how these two aspects would integrate together.<br /><br />As a Senior Developer I have had the opportunity to mentor Junior Developers to share my knowledge and help them with different aspects of their work from which I have gotten positive feedback.<br /><br />The main technologies used are React + TypeScript, C# + .NET, MSSQL and Azure. I have also done some maintenance for existing E2E tests using Robot Framework with Playwright.",
            "Adalia": "Designing and developing web applications both in customer projects in different industries and developing our own Monitoring and Evaluation system.<br /><br />Starting as Junior Developer my responsibilities grew over my time at Adalia meaning I would also get to mentor new Junior Developers who joined after me. This also meant that for some projects I was the sole developer responsible for maintenance and had multiple projects at the same time.<br /><br />For one customer project I had the responsibility to start the implementation of a completely new system from scratch. Creating the application structure (React + Rails), designing data model and implementing user and permission management to provide basis for other people to join development.<br /><br />In another project I implemented offline functionalities to allow the data to be saved whilst the user is offline and synchronization to the server once the user had the network connection again. I also did my master's thesis on this specific subject which included some additional research on the subject such as using service workers to cache application content in the browser.<br /><br />Mostly used technologies were Ruby on Rails, React and PostgreSQL. I also did configurations for services to be run on AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda and worked on a Node.js API.",

            "React": "I have worked with React from the start of my developer career and used both TypeScript and JavaScript. I have designed and implemented several React apps from scratch which has allowed me to try and learn new things about React along the way. I have used React in my personal projects as well such as this website and converted a React PWA to Android app and published it at the Play Store.<br /><br />I have experience from state management libraries like Redux and Redux Toolkit. As well as Redux Offline for my master's thesis to provide offline functionalities for the users. I like to write simple and reusable React components and custom hooks to make the component logic clear and readable. Best thing about React is that you can always learn more and improve.",
            ".NET": "I have worked with C# + .NET backends over a year now at EasyOpp. Currently using mainly .NET 8 and Entity Framework Core in our APIs and NUnit framework for unit tests.<br /><br />Additionally I have also worked with SignalR for sending real-time messages to our React UI from our API. It basically automates a lot of the work the users have to do in the app to log their work. Implementing the backend logic to create and update work-time entries based on vehicle location data and then sending the SignalR messages to the UI was one of the most interesting challenges I have worked on. There was a lot of complex logic and some configurable options involved but despite that the feature has worked well and has required only small tweaks.<br /><br />Despite being quite new to .NET I feel like have accustomed myself with it very quickly and I am able to develop new features effectively while also learning new things about the framework.",
            "Rails": "I have 6 years of experience of maintaining and developing Rails applications both with existing systems and completely new projects. I have used Rails both as a backend API to React UIs and as more traditional MVC framework. I have also setup unit tests using RSpec and used RSpec API Doc Generator to allow automatic generation for API documentation for a Rails API. Additionally I have implemented SAML authentication using Suomi.fi for one of the Rails + React projects to allow the users to authenticate using their bank credentials.<br /><br />I feel like Rails is a beginner friendly framework which is easily approachable and I would be happy to work with Rails in the future as well.",
            "Azure": "I have some experience from different Azure services such as App services, Azure functions and Table Storage. Currently all our apps are hosted in Azure and deployments are configured using Bicep scripts. I had the chance to do the Bicep setup for our new React frontend which is run as an App Service and I'm always interested in learning more about Azure and other cloud services.",
            "AWS": "I have experience of setting up containers to be run in AWS Fargate and configuring load balancers for these services. I have also setup API Gateways using <a href=\"https://docs.rubyonjets.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby on Jets</a> to deploy the application code to be run in AWS Lambda."
